Vertigo installation instructions for DOS
=========================================
Your software comes as a packed file called VER###.ZIP,
where ### is the version number, e.g. VER026.ZIP for version 0.26.
You may unzip the archive using e.g. "WinZip" (tm) - make sure to have the
option for creating subdirectories enabled, or "PKZip" (tm) by the command
"PKUNZIP -d VER###" (the -d option is important in order to create 
sub-directories)

If you are updating an older version of Vertigo, you are advised to delete
your old directory completely to avoid conflicts.

This program is made for DOS. It is usually possible to make it work in a 
DOS shell from Windows. If you encounter problems, I suggest that you boot 
into DOS and install and run Vertigo from there.

Thrustmaster FLCS/TQS users might want to use B50LOAD.BAT for setting up the 
stick. Edit B50LOAD and set the paths as required. Note, that the idea of
calling B50LOAD.EXE from C:\TQS is to always keep the B50LOAD.DAT file in
the same place - this avoids unnecessary uploads if used consistently.

Note the system requirements:  An analog joystick and game port are strongly 
recommended, but a mouse can be used in stead. 
A fast PC does not hurt, either - otherwise you will have to turn off some 
graphics to make it run properly.
Only Sound-blaster compatible sound cards are supported.

To make sure the sound is configured correctly, define the BLASTER variable,
e.g. by inserting 
SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 H1 T4
with the proper parameters in your autoexec.bat.
See also the sound config instructions at the bottom of this text, if the
method above does not work.
If you still have no success, and trying to setup sound causes program halts,
call the program with the option "-nosound".

For information on how to fly and optimize performance of Vertigo, read the
VERTIGO.TXT or VER_DOCS.HTM and the KEYS.TXT files. It is especially
important to read the sections on adjusting the calculation rate and
landscape drawing distance.

Now, finally, you can call VERTIGO.EXE to step into the cockpit.

During the initial display of the menu, you will be able to select screen 
resolution. In-flight, this is not possible.

Calibration of the joystick may cause a pause with about 10 sec of black 
screen before the flight starts, and upset the timing and sound. Therefore,
It is recommended to re-start the program after joystick calibration.


Happy flying,

The text below is snatched from Shawn Hargreaves documentation on his sound 
routines, and may be useful if you cannot make your sound card work:

=============================================
============ Sound configuration ============
=============================================

When Allegro initialises the sound routines, it reads a file called 
sound.cfg from the current directory. If the soundcard autodetection doesn't 
work properly, you can use this file to control the sound code.

The '#' character begins a comment. Apart from comments, sound.cfg can 
contain any of the statements:

digi_card = x
   Sets the driver to use for playing samples, where x is one of the values:
      0 = none            1 = SB (autodetect breed)
      2 = SB 1.0          3 = SB 1.5 
      4 = SB 2.0          5 = SB Pro
      6 = SB16

flip_pan = x
   Toggling this between 0 and 1 reverses the left/right panning of samples, 
   which might be needed because some SB cards (including mine :-) get the 
   stereo image the wrong way round.

sb_port = x
   Sets the port address of the SB (this is usually 220).

sb_dma = x
   Sets the DMA channel for the SB (this is usually 1).

sb_irq = x
   Sets the IRQ for the SB (this is usually 7).

sb_freq = x
   Sets the sample playback frequency. This defaults to 16000. Other 
   possible values are 8000, 11025, and 22050.
