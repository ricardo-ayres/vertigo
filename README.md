# Vertigo

[Vertigo](http://stjerneskud.info/vertigo/ "Vertigo") is a public domain flight simulator, written by Anton Norup SÃ¸rensen.

Emphasis is on realism of the flight-model, with several types of air- and space-crafts selectable.

## Update

I have uploaded this with minor fixes to compile under modern Linux with CGUI 2.1.0 and allegro 4.4.
