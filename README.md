# Vertigo

[Vertigo](http://stjerneskud.info/vertigo/ "Vertigo") is a public domain
flight simulator, written by Anton Norup Sørensen.

Emphasis is on realism of the flight-model, with several types of air- and
space-crafts selectable.

## Update

I have uploaded this with minor fixes to compile under modern Linux with
CGUI 2.1.0 and allegro 4.4.

### Instructions

Compile CGUI with STATICLINK=1 and point CGUIPATH in makedefs to the directory
you compiled cgui in. It's not necessary to install CGUI system-wide.
